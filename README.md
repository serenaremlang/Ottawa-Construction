If you're from Ottawa, you're likely getting pretty tired of all the construction. It almost seems like Ottawa is starting to compete with Montreal's never ending [Vito Rizzuto construction Empire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/24/corrupt-quebec-construction-industry-ruled-by-untouchable-groups-report). We propose to build a tool to help locals and visitors alike to navigate all the projects taking place in Ottawa and how they might impact travel within the city.
